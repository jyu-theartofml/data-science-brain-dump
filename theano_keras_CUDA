Check this first to run theano on GPU: use cs231n ami which has reconfigured Theano, Keras, python and CUDA
http://efavdb.com/deep-learning-with-jupyter-on-aws/, use impiyush (code way) to do the config file for c.notebook. The user bash file in efavdb
does not work. 

Then update Keras to latest version like the following link, and also install opencv (conda install opencv), and also configure theanorc file.
If theanorc file is not configured, it doesn't default to GPU.

Note, the commands presented need to be run in Anaconda command prompt
the second link worked on windows 10 and python 2.7 env, follow instructions, esp in creating .theanorc file. it  should be .theanorc , no name infront of the .
