# Welcome!

<p> This repository serves as a brain dump for the vast source of data science/analytic blogs and tutorials that I find helpful. Feel free to share ones that you think are interesting!

## Analytics Vidhya 
https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/
<p>For me this is by far the most visited web site to read up on a particular method, algorithm, or computing library. They have bloggers with diverse set of expertise in data science, and they have sections devoted to learning R, Python, Weka, Tableau and D3! What I like about this blog is that topics range from beginner to advanced. It's easy to get addicted to the content and spend hours on this blog. </p>

## Cambridge Coding Academy
http://online.cambridgecoding.com/quick-courses
<p>This is a very Python-centric web portal that offers quick tutorials targeted at beginners or intermediate users in Python. The topics range from finding the best beer to Panda tricks every Data Scientist should know to analyzing genetic ancestry with 23AndMe data. Each post is concise, and it offers detailed Python script. Great for beginner in Machine Learning and Python. </p>

## Dataquest Blog
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/
<p>This is a blog written by Vik Paruchuri, a data science based in SF. He writes a post about twice a month to cover a particular topic. It has many useful tips, and he explains things very clearly and does example problem in Python code (mostly). I think this blog offers a glimps of the concrete skills companies are looking for in a data scientist.</p>

## Everybody's Favorite Data Blog
http://efavdb.com/
<p>I learned to do my first Kaggle data analysis by reading from this blog! It's got a quirky vibe and the blog talks about diverse range of topics (including software accessories in doing machine learning).

## Terra Incognita
http://blog.christianperone.com/
<p>In describing data science, machine learning as the "Unknown Land", Christiane dives into advanced machine learning topics such as Deep learning, extracting hypercolumns in Convolutional Neural Net, and Genetic Algorithm.</p>

## Sebastian Raschka
https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/index.html
<p> This guy wrote books on machine learning and explains the assortment of methods in Python. His blog post goes into great depth in explaining a topic, talks alot about theories too. Great source of material to gain a deeper understanding. </p>
